# It is unreasonable to have the same eyeglasses prescribed to people with different vision needs. Why would it be reasonable to prescribe the same typography to people with different reading needs?

## Lexend is a variable font empirically shown to improve reading-proficiency significantly.
### As prescription eyeglasses achieve proficiency for persons with short-sightedness, Lexend employs variable font technology to prescribe a personalized axis setting according to the Shaver-Troup Formulations.


> ![](/static/images/noordzji-cover-cut.png) The word is the condition for reading. The word consists of both white and black forms in rhythm units. If the rhythm is weak; the word is poorly formed. If the rhythm is absent; there is no word. Reading is a spatial manner of intervals in both length and breadth.… Ignoring the white by pedagogy places civilization at risk. What is civilization if not the cultural community dependent on reading?

######  Excerpts from “The Stroke” by Gerrit Noordzji

#  The US Department of Education reports that only **36% of students are reading-proficient**. That would appear to confirm Noordzij’s hyperbolic warning.

## Reading-Proficiency is measured in fluency.
Within education, there is consensus that reading fluency is one of the defining characteristics of good readers, and a lack of fluency is a common characteristic of poor readers.

Differences in reading fluency not only distinguish good readers from poor, but a lack of reading fluency is also a reliable predictor of reading comprehension problems (Stanovich, 1991). Once struggling readers learn sound–symbol relationships through intervention and become accurate decoders, their lack of fluency emerges as the next hurdle they face on their way to reading proficiency (Torgesen et al., 2001; Torgesen, Rashotte, Alexander, Alexander, & MacPhee, 2003).

This lack of fluent reading is a problem for poor readers because they tend to read in a labored, disconnected fashion with a focus on decoding at the word level that makes comprehension of the text difficult, if not impossible.

## Fluency is measured in Words Correct Per Minute (WCPM).

A student reads a story with <TotalNumberOfWords/> words in <TotalAmountOfTime/>. She made <TotalNumberOfErrors/> errors. To determine WCPM:

1. Count the total number of words. Example: <code><TotalNumberOfWords/></code>
2. Count the number of mistakes. Example: <code><TotalNumberOfErrors/></code>
3. Take the number of words minus the number of mistakes = number of words read correctly. Example: <code><TotalNumberOfWords/> - <TotalNumberOfErrors/> = <TotalNumberOfCorrectWords/></code>
4. Convert the time it took to read the passage to seconds. Example: <code><TotalAmountOfTime/> = <TotalAmountOfTime as="seconds"/>s</code>
5. Convert the number of seconds to a decimal by dividing the number of seconds by 60. This is the total reading time. Example: <code><TotalAmountOfTime as="seconds"/>s / 60 = <TotalAmountOfTime as="decimal"/></code>
6. Divide the number of words read correctly by the total reading time in decimal form. Example: <code><TotalNumberOfCorrectWords/> / <TotalAmountOfTime as="decimal"/> = <TotalWordsCorrectPerMinute/> WCPM</code>

## The Shaver-Troup Formulations

As an educational therapist, in 1999, Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup observed that reading issues masked the individual’s true capability and intelligence. Shaver-Troup theorized that these issues were a sensitivity to typographical factors. She began manipulating multiple text factors, specifically facets of shape, size and spacing to find a match between text format and an individual’s optimized visual processing capabilities.

In clinical practice with both children and adults, Dr. Shaver-Troup used a fluency test to measure the effectiveness of the solution. Test results supported her theory; making the modifications to text format allowed the reader to instantaneously improve accurate reading speed, which research correlates to increased comprehension. The solution does not require additional time or training. This fluency effect is instantaneous.

### The Shaver-Troup Formulations Examined

Three factors are manipulated in a six font series in increasing intensity that alter a text format, creating an immediate improvement in reading performance.

- Hyper expansion of character spacing
- Expanded font-outline shapes
- Sans-serif font to reduce noise

### The Demonstration of Effectiveness

20 third graders, containing eight males and twelve females, read for one minute in five fonts.

All text was set at 16pt and the reading materials were two grade levels above the participants current grade level to ensure the typography was being measured rather than reading competency.

Each student read out load a passage set in a control of Times New Roman, then four of the Lexend Series — Regular, Deca, Mega, and Giga.

## A Virtue of Variable Font Technology

As the study demonstrates, no one setting worked best for all students. Diverse readers need different Lexend settings, like persons with weaker vision requires a more intense glasses prescription.

Eyeglass prescriptions are not six strict settings. There are more granular settings possible.

Variable font technology allows for continuous selection of the Lexend Series to find the specific setting for an individual student.

# Speculative Interlude

At the end of the 2018 project, Thomas identified research by Dr. Nadine Chahine on reading proficiency in Arabic. The conclusion and implication of her research supports the reasonable proposal to apply the hyper-expansion of Lex.end into an Arabic variable font.

Aspects of hyper-extension are already established in Arabic. The lengthening of text for justification is named kashida, and lashida aids in legibility:

> kadshida: to give a better character layout on the baseline, and to lessen the cluttering at the joint point between two successive letters of the same word

There is a proposal for the VF axis called gext (Glyph Extension) by Sahar Afshar and José Solé. Here is a demonstration of gext. The axis gext would entail kashida.

Nadine conjectured kashida of different intensities could aid with fluency.
This was conjectured prior to this proposal of Lexend Arabic.

Even more speculatively, the hyper-expansion in Lexend may be possible for Hangul, the script of Korean. Research, collaboration with many disciplines, and empirical examination is required.
